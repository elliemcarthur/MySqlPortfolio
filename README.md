This is a step by step process of different queries of a fake database I created to demonstrate my knowledge.  Attached in this repository will be a Text File and Word file that displays what I am trying to do with each query.  Each query will be numbered in order of each step I will do and will correspond with the Txt/Word file.  A different respository will be created for my homework for what I learned in class for SQL.  However, I would like to also take my own approach as well.  Data will be also used here from a txt file and a Excel file, which I will use to upload data.  Feel free to download either/or to be able to follow along with the queries.  There will be a section that displays this work in OOP as well.  Thank you and enjoy!
